A software engineer with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering and 7 years of experience in Android development. My expertise spans fintech, messaging, maps & navigation, and marketplaces. Iâ€™ve worked in diverse environments, from startups to large enterprises, adapting to team structures like Spotify tribe, feature teams, squads, and cross-functional teams using agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban.

I focus on best practices, staying updated with trends, testing in different pyramids and TDD, and integrating CI/CD and code reviews. I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others, having delivered technical presentations and mentored junior engineers. Iâ€™ve also improved onboarding processes and refined interview processes in collaboration with HR.

I take ownership of my tasks, ensuring close communication with stakeholders like designers, product managers, and backend teams to deliver high-quality results. I handle obstacles smoothly and keep progress steady.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve tackled performance issues, decreased startup time and CPU usage, fixed bottlenecks, added accessibility features, and interviewed users to address pain points. As a pragmatic engineer, I view problems from multiple perspectives, apply critical thinking, and focus on delivering the best user experience.
